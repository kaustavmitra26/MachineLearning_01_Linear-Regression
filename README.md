# MachineLearning_01_Linear-Regression
Supervised learning is divided into two types: Regression and classification. Further , Regression is also sub-divided into other types, of which 'LINEAR REGRESSION' is the basic one.

The Assumptions of linear Rgression:
1.The distribution of residuals is normal (at each value of the dependent variable).
2.The variance of the residuals for every set of values for the independent variable is equal. (violation is called heteroscedasticity)
3.The error term is additive no interactions.
4. At every value of the dependent variable the expected (mean) value of the residuals is zero (No non-linear relationships)
5.The expected correlation between residuals, for any two cases, is 0.(The independence assumption (lack of autocorrelation))
6.All independent variables are uncorrelated with the error term.
7.No independent variables are a perfect linear function of other independent variables (no perfect multicollinearity)
8.The mean of the error term is zero.

Making Predictions with Linear Regression:
 Imagine we are predicting weight (y) from height (x). Our linear regression model representation for this problem would be:

y = B0 + B1 * x1

or

weight =B0 +B1 * height
